Hi, I'm Sushmitha Jayaramaiah.
I'm a Computer Science graduate student at Colorado State University with interest in big data, machine learning, 
and learning about software engineering processes that helps build efficient maintenable code.
Recently, I developed interest in learning about web technologies and currently I'm doing an online course on javascript and react.
